# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide webpage was created for Denver University's Coding Boot Camp prework. Its purpose was to store and organize the information I learned about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript throughout the prework. As the project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, it also served as a hands-on learning tool that allowed me to visualize, interact with, and practice the topics and tools I was studying.

## Installation

To install Google Chrome, simply open your current browser and search <i>Google Chrome</i>, or enter Google.com/chrome into your address box.

## Usage

This webpage contains bullet lists briefly reviewing HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Read its contents from top to bottom, or open your Google Chrome DevTools and navigate to the console panel for a randomized suggestion on which topic to begin reading first. (Refer to [Installation](#installation) for help installing Google Chrome or Google Chrome DevTools.)
